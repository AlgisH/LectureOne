Lecture One
===========

The notes and "exercise" for our first CompSoc lecture on 29/10!

This will be updated as the time approaches with my notes and the important git commands.

The "exercise" (obviously non-compulsory, but it will be a way for you to check that you've understood everything fine) is stored in ATTENDEES.md.
